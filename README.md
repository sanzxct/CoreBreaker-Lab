CoreBreaker-Lab
Low-level security research project exploring the Apple Hypervisor Framework on M4 silicon. This lab focuses on building a custom hardware-isolated sandbox to execute ARM64 instructions at Exception Level 1 (EL1).

Objectives
Hardware Interaction: Direct communication with the M4 chip via Hypervisor.framework.

Security Research: Isolated environment for malware analysis and kernel-mode experimentation.

Architecture: Hands-on GPA to HVA memory mapping and ARM64 assembly execution.

Technical Stack
Hardware: Apple M4 (ARM64)

Language: C++20 / ARM64 Assembly

Security: Code Signing with Hypervisor Entitlements
